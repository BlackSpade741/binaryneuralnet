# binaryneuralnet
#
# This is my second time attempting to create a Neural Network with two inputs and one output. Ideally when complete it should be possible to train this Neural Network to simulate binary operators such as AND OR and XOR, independent of any actual logical operators from the language I am using to implement the Neural Network (JAVA).
