# binaryneuralnet
 A elementary feedforward multilayer perceptron Neural Network designed to pattern match basic binary operators such as And Or and Xor. Successfully converges when "hinted" values are used.

 Inspired by lectures from Jeff Heaton's videos on Neural Networks found here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR1-GEpyOPzT2AO4D_eifdw

What is does:
The Binary Operators AND, OR, and XOR are the basis for propositional logic which is fundamental to a great deal of topics in mathematics and computer science. When many university students take their first course in propositional logic they learn the truth tables for these operators, this Neural Network does just that. When given a truth table the Neural Network cannot correctly apply the operators in it's initial (untrained) state however, following proper training the Neural Network can "learn" the correct patterns for the different operators and apply them with a high degree of accuracy.
